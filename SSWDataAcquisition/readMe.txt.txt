# Project Readme: Data Acquisition From National Instruments (NI) Devices with NIDAQ

This repository serves as a guide and resource for acquiring data using National Instruments (NI) devices, specifically the NIDAQ, within a MATLAB environment. It covers the process of acquiring single scans, continuous readings, and the ability to capture signals with a trigger, allowing you to save only those scans of interest.

## Installation Steps for NIDAQ Drivers and MATLAB Toolbox

1. **Install NIDAQmx Drivers**:
   - Download and install the latest version of NIDAQmx Drivers from [here](https://www.ni.com/es/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#484356).

2. **Connect Your NI Device**:
   - Connect your NI device and wait for the pop-up window of the NI Device Manager to appear. Once it does, open MATLAB.

3. **Install MATLAB Add-Ons**:
   - In MATLAB, install the following Add-Ons:
     - Data Acquisition Toolbox
     - Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices

4. **Getting Started**:
   - You can start using data acquisition with NIDAQ by utilizing the provided MATLAB scripts or following the tutorial available at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/help/daq/acquire-data-using-ni-devices.html).
     - *Note*: Additionally, you can refer to the documentation from the Data Acquisition Toolbox Support Package for National Instruments NI-DAQmx Devices.

   - For specific guidance on acquiring continuous and background data using NI devices, you can visit [this tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/help/daq/acquire-continuous-and-background-data-using-ni-devices.html).
